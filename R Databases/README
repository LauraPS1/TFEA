Each file on this folder contains a database ready to use with the R package TFEA.ChIP.

Currently available databases are:

### Human ChIP-Seq databases:

TSS1kb.Rdata: links genes to ChIP-Seq experiments with peaks up to 1Kb from a gene.

TSS5kb.Rdata: links genes to ChIP-Seq experiments with peaks up to 5Kb from a gene.

TSS5kb+distantSites.Rdata: includes binding to enhancers linked to known genes[1] 

TSS10kb.Rdata: links genes to ChIP-Seq experiments with peaks up to 10Kb from a gene.

TSS10kb+distantSites.Rdata: includes binding to enhancers linked to known genes[1]

### Mouse ChIP-seq databases:

mm_TSS1kb:links genes to ChIP-Seq experiments with peaks up to 1Kb from a gene.

mm_TSS5kb.Rdata: links genes to ChIP-Seq experiments with peaks up to 5Kb from a gene.

mm_TSS10kb.Rdata: links genes to ChIP-Seq experiments with peaks up to 10Kb from a gene.
